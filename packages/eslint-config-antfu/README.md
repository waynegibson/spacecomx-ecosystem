# @spacecomx/eslint-config-antfu

The [eslint preset](https://github.com/antfu/eslint-config) was created by Anthony Fu. The preset does not use prettier, but instead uses eslint rules for code formatting.

## Features

- Single quotes, no semi
- Auto fix for formatting (aimed to be used standalone without Prettier)
- Designed to work with TypeScript, Vue out-of-box
- Lint also for json, yaml, markdown
- Sorted imports, dangling commas
- Reasonable defaults, best practices, only one-line of config
- Style principle: Minimal for reading, stable for diff

> You don't need .eslintignore normally as it has been provided by the preset.
